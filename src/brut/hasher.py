"""This module provides simple safe hashing functions.

We only support several of the available hashing algorithms from :mod:`hashlib` as
they have several that are never really used (such as ``sha224``). However, we do supply
support for `xxhash <https://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/>`_ as we typically will be
calculating checksums for files >1GB which is safe and **very** fast using xxhash.

.. tip:: The provided basic functions allow you to calculate multiple hashes at the same
    time which means that your bottleneck will be whatever slowest hashing algorithm you
    request.
